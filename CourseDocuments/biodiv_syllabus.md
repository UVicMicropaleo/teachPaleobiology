## COURSE PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES

Biodiversity is a foundational concept in ecology (paleobiology) that is meant to describe biological variety within an ecosystem. It is regularly used to measure the complexity, health, and history of natural systems, and it is a mainstay - perhaps even *the* principal feature - of analytical paleobiology. 

Unfortunately, despite its fundamental role and frequent use in ecological analyses, biodiversity actually has **no universally agreed upon theoretical or mathematical definition**, and there are many competing formulations of biodiversity that are *not* interchangable - though some have predictable mathematical relationships with each other. As a result, there is no universally "right" or "wrong" way to characterize biodiversity, and the appropriate method of measurement can only be decided within the context of a specific scientific hypothesis.

Therefore, the primary **learning objectives** for this section are to:
    
1. Define the many competing conceptions of biodiversity and their mathematical formalizations.
2. Identify the theoretical implications of each metric and when they are scientifically appropriate.
3. Cover additional operational considerations (e.g., sample standardization) of measuring biodiversity with different types of paleontological data.
4. Have fun, maybe.
  
## COURSEWORK ORGANIZATION	
The course is loosely structured around two sets of approximately 1.5-hours of lecture and 2.5-hours of lab, with an hour of lunch inbetween. 

### DAY 1 - SET 1 (8:00 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.)
Topic | Definition
---- | ----
Biodiversity Introductory Lecture | The basic components and origins of biodiversity theory (abundance, richness, evenness, and complexity).
Evenness Lab Exercise | 1. Practical examples of vastly differing interpretations when using richness vs. complexity. 2. How to derive RADs, Lorenz curves, and Gini coefficients. 3. How to derive and interpret measures of information entropy (Pachinko!).

### DAY 1 - SET 2 (1:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.)
Topic | Definition
---- | ----
The Problems of Evenness (continued) | Simple discussion of non-linear regression methods and Hubbell's neutral theory.
Neutral Theory Lab Exercise | 1. Proof of how moments are inadequate for describing a distribution. 2. Application of different non-linear regression methods. 3. Building a neutral model simulation (may continue into the following day).

### DAY 2 - SET 1 (8:00 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.)
Topic | Definition
---- | ----
The Problems of Richness | A discussion of the species-area effect, standardization techniques, and extrapolation methods.
Standardization Exercise | Practical examples of various subsampling and extrapolation techniques.

### DAY 2 - SET 2 (1:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.)
Topic | Definition
---- | ----
Phanerozoic Biodiversity Lecture | The scientific and historical background of the "trajectory of Phanerozoic biodiversity" question. 
Time-Series Analysis Exercise | Basic analysis of creating standardized Phanerozoic biodiversity curve and correlation with environmental variables. 

### DAY 3 - SET 1 (8:00 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.)
Topic | Definition
---- | ----
Spatial Biodiveristy Dynamics | The importance of spatial scale to biodiversity
Time-Series Analysis Exercise 2 | Alpha, beta, and gamma biodiveristy lab exercise

### DAY 3 - SET 2 (1:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.)
Topic | Definition
---- | ----
Rates, Periodicity, and Basic | Limited discusion of turnover rates, Live-Death bodel, and Periodicity analysis
Periodicity and Birth-Death Lab | Recreation of the original [Raup and Sepkoski periodicity analysis](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/81/3/801.full.pdf), and an applied [birth-death model](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate/tree/master/tutorials#birth-death-models-with-time-continuous-correlates) based off of a continuous, "independent" time-series of the rock-record from [Macrostrat](https://macrostrat.org/).
